# WebSocket Architecture Design

WebSockets provide full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, enabling real-time bidirectional communication between clients and servers. Unlike HTTP's request-response model, WebSockets maintain persistent connections that allow servers to push data to clients without being prompted by a new request.

The protocol begins with an HTTP handshake that upgrades to the WebSocket protocol (ws:// or wss://). After this upgrade, both client and server can send messages independently at any time until the connection is closed. WebSockets are particularly valuable for applications requiring real-time updates like chat applications, collaborative tools, live dashboards, and multiplayer games.

When designing WebSocket-based systems, key architectural components include connection managers (handling socket lifecycle), message handlers (processing incoming messages), broadcasting mechanisms (for sending to multiple clients), and reconnection strategies (handling network disruptions). For scalability, considerations include using connection pooling, implementing horizontal scaling with sticky sessions or shared state, and managing connection limits per server.

Common design patterns include Pub/Sub systems where clients subscribe to topics/channels, event-sourcing patterns for maintaining and replaying state, and Command-Query-Responsibility-Segregation (CQRS) to separate read and write operations.

Practical implementation challenges include handling connection state across server instances, implementing authentication and authorization for persistent connections, managing connection timeouts and heartbeats, and gracefully handling reconnections. For production systems, it's essential to implement proper monitoring of connection counts, message throughput, and error rates, while planning for graceful degradation to polling if WebSocket connections fail.
