The API Gateway pattern is a server that acts as an API front-end, receiving API requests and routing them to appropriate backend services. It serves as a single entry point for clients, abstracting the underlying system architecture. Key responsibilities include request routing, composition (aggregating results from multiple services), protocol translation, and authentication/authorization. API gateways implement rate limiting, caching, and request/response transformation. They're particularly valuable in microservices architectures by providing a unified interface and handling cross-cutting concerns. Potential drawbacks include increased complexity and the risk of becoming a performance bottleneck. Modern implementations like Kong, AWS API Gateway, or Spring Cloud Gateway offer features like traffic management, monitoring, and developer portals. This pattern works well when you need to expose different API shapes for different clients while maintaining a clean internal architecture.
