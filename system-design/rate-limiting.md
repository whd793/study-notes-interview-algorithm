Rate limiting is a technique to control the amount of requests a client can make to an API within a time period, protecting backend services from being overwhelmed. Common algorithms include Token Bucket (accumulates tokens at a fixed rate), Leaky Bucket (processes requests at a constant rate), and Fixed Window (limits requests in discrete time windows). Distributed rate limiting requires synchronization across multiple servers, typically using Redis or a similar store to maintain shared counters. Implementation considerations include response status codes (usually 429 Too Many Requests), retry headers to indicate when to try again, and client identification strategies like API keys or IP addresses. Rate limiting can be implemented at different levels - API gateway, middleware, or application code. It's essential for preventing abuse, managing resources fairly among users, ensuring service stability, and sometimes for monetization through tiered API access levels. The specific approach should be tailored to the application's traffic patterns and requirements.
