# Video Streaming Platform Architecture

Video streaming platforms deliver media content to viewers with minimal buffering and appropriate quality for their devices and network conditions. These systems handle content ingestion, processing, storage, delivery, and playback while managing massive storage and bandwidth requirements.

The architecture typically includes ingest services (receiving raw content), transcoding pipelines (creating multiple formats and qualities), content management systems (organizing and protecting media), delivery networks (efficiently serving content), and client-side players (adapting to viewing conditions).

Transcoding converts source videos into multiple formats (H.264, H.265, VP9, AV1) and quality levels (bitrates, resolutions) to support various devices and network conditions. This process creates an adaptive bitrate (ABR) ladder allowing clients to switch quality levels seamlessly as conditions change. For live streaming, low-latency protocols like CMAF, LL-HLS, or WebRTC minimize delay between capture and viewing.

Content delivery leverages CDNs to cache video segments close to viewers, reducing latency and backbone traffic. Origin shielding protects source servers from excessive load during viral content spikes. Multi-CDN strategies improve reliability and optimize cost by routing viewers to the best-performing network for their location.

Adaptive streaming protocols (HLS, DASH) break videos into small segments (2-10 seconds) and use manifest files to inform players about available qualities. Players monitor download speeds and buffer levels to select appropriate segments, balancing quality against buffering risk.

Storage strategies separate hot content (popular videos accessed frequently) from cold content (long-tail videos rarely viewed), using appropriate storage tiers for cost efficiency. Content popularity analytics drive caching decisions and storage tier placement.

Scalability considerations include elastic transcoding capacity for upload spikes, request distribution across global regions, and handling concurrent viewers for popular content. Live events present particular challenges with sudden viewer influxes.

Analytics track quality of experience metrics (startup time, rebuffering, play failures) alongside engagement data (watch time, drop-off points) to identify technical issues and content performance. Real-time monitoring enables immediate response to delivery problems before they impact large audiences.
