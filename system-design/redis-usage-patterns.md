# Redis Usage Patterns in System Design

Redis is an in-memory data structure store that serves as a database, cache, message broker, and streaming engine. Its versatility makes it useful for numerous patterns beyond simple caching.

As a distributed cache, Redis reduces database load by storing frequently accessed data in memory. It supports various eviction policies (LRU, LFU) and can persist cache to disk for recovery. Implementation requires careful consideration of key design, TTL settings, and cache invalidation strategies.

Redis excels as a session store due to its speed and built-in key expiration. It can store user sessions with automatic expiry and support session clustering across multiple application servers, providing consistent user experiences in distributed environments.

As a rate limiter, Redis's atomic operations enable implementing token bucket or sliding window algorithms to control API request rates. Commands like INCR with expiry provide simple yet effective rate limiting capabilities.

Redis Pub/Sub enables real-time messaging between applications, supporting event-driven architectures. For more robust messaging needs, Redis Streams provides persistent, consumer-group based message processing with acknowledgments.

Leaderboards and real-time analytics leverage Redis's sorted sets for maintaining ordered data with O(log N) operations. This enables efficient tracking of top scores, trending items, or real-time metrics with minimal code.

Distributed locking with Redis ensures synchronized access to resources across distributed systems. The SETNX command with expiration time enables implementing locks with automatic release to prevent deadlocks.

Geospatial operations in Redis support location-based features like finding nearby places using commands like GEOADD and GEORADIUS, with efficient indexing for quick proximity searches.

When implementing Redis, architectural considerations include clustering for horizontal scaling, sentinel for high availability, appropriate persistence configuration, and memory management strategies to prevent out-of-memory situations.
