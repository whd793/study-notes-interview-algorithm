# Notification System Architecture

Notification systems deliver timely information to users across multiple channels like push notifications, email, SMS, and in-app messages. These systems handle event ingestion, user targeting, delivery, and tracking while maintaining scalability and reliability.

The architecture typically includes event sources (applications generating notification triggers), an event ingestion layer (receiving and validating events), a processing engine (applying routing rules and personalization), channel-specific delivery services, and analytics components for tracking engagement.

Event ingestion requires high availability and must handle traffic spikes during peak notification periods. A message queue like Kafka or RabbitMQ decouples event producers from processors, providing buffering capacity and ensuring no notification triggers are lost during processing delays.

The processing engine determines which users should receive notifications based on subscription preferences, user segmentation, and delivery rules. It enriches events with user-specific data, personalizes content, and handles localization. Rate limiting and throttling prevent notification fatigue by controlling frequency at user and application levels.

Delivery services manage channel-specific requirements: interfacing with push notification services (FCM, APNS), email delivery providers (SMTP servers, services like SendGrid), SMS gateways, and in-app notification storage. Each channel presents unique challenges like device token management for push or deliverability concerns for email.

Reliability mechanisms include retry policies with exponential backoff, dead-letter queues for failed deliveries, and circuit breakers to handle external service outages. For mission-critical notifications, multi-channel fallback strategies ensure message delivery when the primary channel fails.

Scalability considerations include horizontal scaling of all components, database sharding for user preferences and delivery status, and caching frequently accessed data like templates and user settings. Analytics track delivery, open rates, and engagement across channels to optimize notification effectiveness and timing.

Operational concerns include monitoring delivery success rates, maintaining provider health dashboards, implementing template versioning, and providing self-service preference management for end users.
