# Recommendation Engine Architecture

Recommendation engines analyze user behavior and item characteristics to suggest relevant content, products, or connections to users. These systems balance accuracy, novelty, diversity, and computational efficiency to drive engagement and conversions.

Core architectural components include data collection pipelines (gathering user interactions and item metadata), feature processing (extracting and transforming relevant signals), model training infrastructure, recommendation serving systems (generating real-time suggestions), and evaluation frameworks.

Recommendation approaches fall into several categories: collaborative filtering leverages user-item interaction patterns to identify similarities between users or items; content-based filtering uses item attributes and user preferences; knowledge-based systems apply explicit rules and constraints; and hybrid approaches combine multiple techniques for improved results.

Data processing pipelines aggregate implicit signals (clicks, views, time spent) and explicit feedback (ratings, likes) along with contextual information (time, location, device). Feature engineering transforms raw data into model inputs, including embedding generation for categorical features and temporal dynamics capturing to represent evolving preferences.

Modern implementations typically employ deep learning models such as neural collaborative filtering, sequence models (RNNs, Transformers) for session-based recommendations, or graph neural networks for complex relationship modeling. These models are periodically retrained on historical data while maintaining near real-time feature updates.

The serving architecture separates offline computation (candidate generation, model training) from online serving (real-time scoring, ranking, and filtering). This typically involves precomputing recommendation candidates for fast retrieval, with real-time personalization applied at serving time.

Scalability challenges include handling millions of users and items, managing cold-start problems for new entities, and balancing computation costs with recommendation freshness. Techniques like approximate nearest neighbor search, model distillation, and intelligent caching help maintain performance at scale.

Evaluation metrics combine offline measures (precision, recall, NDCG) with online A/B testing examining business metrics (engagement, conversion, revenue). Multi-armed bandit approaches enable continuous exploration and exploitation to improve recommendations over time while managing the exploration-exploitation tradeoff.
