# Identity and Access Management System Design

Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems control authentication (verifying who users are) and authorization (determining what they can access). These systems provide secure, scalable identity services across applications while balancing security with user experience.

Core components include identity stores (managing user attributes and credentials), authentication services (validating user identity), authorization engines (enforcing access policies), directory services (organizing users and resources), and administration interfaces (managing the system).

Identity management handles the lifecycle of digital identities: creation, provisioning across systems, attribute updates, and deactivation. Modern systems support identity federation, allowing authentication across organizational boundaries through standards like SAML, OpenID Connect, and OAuth 2.0.

Authentication incorporates multiple factors: knowledge factors (passwords, security questions), possession factors (mobile devices, hardware tokens), and inherence factors (biometrics). Adaptive authentication adjusts requirements based on risk signals such as location, device, and behavior patterns.

Authorization models include role-based access control (RBAC), assigning permissions to roles rather than individuals; attribute-based access control (ABAC), making decisions based on user attributes and environmental conditions; and relationship-based access control (ReBAC), determining access based on relationships between entities.

Policy enforcement occurs at multiple levels: at the IAM system for coarse-grained decisions, at API gateways for service-level protection, and within applications for fine-grained control. Centralized policy administration with distributed enforcement provides consistent security with acceptable performance.

Scalability considerations include directory partitioning for large user bases, caching frequently accessed identity information, and token-based architectures to reduce authentication service load. High availability configurations ensure authentication services remain operational during component failures.

Security practices include credential encryption, limiting session duration, implementing robust API security, regular security assessments, and comprehensive audit logging. Privacy features include consent management, data minimization, and retention policies compliant with regulations like GDPR.

Enterprise implementations often integrate with existing directories (Active Directory, LDAP) while supporting modern protocols and cloud services. Cloud-native approaches may use managed identity providers like AWS IAM, Azure AD, or Google Cloud Identity along with service mesh technology for fine-grained microservice access control.
