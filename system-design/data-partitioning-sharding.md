# Data Partitioning and Sharding

Data partitioning (or sharding) is a database architecture technique that splits large databases into smaller, more manageable parts called partitions or shards. Each shard is a separate database instance holding a subset of the data, while still representing the same schema. This approach allows databases to scale horizontally by distributing data across multiple servers.

Common partitioning strategies include: Horizontal (row-based) sharding, where different rows are stored in different shards based on a partition key; Vertical partitioning, which splits different columns or features into separate databases; and Directory-based sharding, which maintains a lookup service to track which data is stored on which shard.

Partition key selection is critical and should be based on data access patterns. Ideal partition keys distribute data evenly, minimize cross-shard operations, and align with common query patterns. Options include hash-based partitioning (using hash of a key), range-based partitioning (by value ranges), and geographic partitioning (by user location).

Challenges include handling joins across shards, maintaining referential integrity, rebalancing data as shards grow, and managing distributed transactions. Practical considerations involve implementing a consistent routing layer, handling schema changes across all shards simultaneously, and establishing proper monitoring for shard health and distribution metrics.

Most modern database systems offer built-in sharding capabilities, including MongoDB (with automatic sharding), Amazon DynamoDB (with partition keys), Google Cloud Spanner (with interleaved tables), and sharding middleware for traditional RDBMSs like Vitess for MySQL.
