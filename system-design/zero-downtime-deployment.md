# Zero Downtime Deployment Strategies

Zero downtime deployment (or continuous deployment) allows system updates without service interruption. This approach maintains availability while introducing new features or fixing bugs, which is critical for systems that require 24/7 operation.

The most common strategies include:

Blue-Green Deployment: Involves maintaining two identical production environments (Blue and Green). At any time, only one serves production traffic. New code is deployed to the inactive environment, tested, and then traffic is switched over. Benefits include simple rollback by switching back to the previous environment and complete testing in production-identical conditions. Challenges include maintaining two environments and handling database schema changes.

Canary Deployment: Gradually routes a small percentage of traffic to the new version, monitoring for issues before expanding the rollout. This provides early warning of problems while limiting impact to a subset of users. Canary deployments require sophisticated traffic routing and monitoring capabilities but offer excellent risk mitigation.

Rolling Deployment: Updates instances in a cluster one at a time or in small groups. Traffic continues flowing to non-updated instances while updates occur. This requires less infrastructure than blue-green but increases deployment time and complexity when handling inter-service compatibility.

Feature Toggles: Code changes are deployed to production but remain inactive until enabled via configuration, allowing deployment and release to be separate concerns. This enables trunk-based development and A/B testing but increases code complexity.

Key considerations for any zero downtime strategy include database schema migrations (using backward-compatible changes, schema versioning, or dual-writes), handling in-flight transactions during deployment, maintaining API compatibility between versions, and implementing comprehensive monitoring to quickly detect deployment issues.
