Load balancing is the process of distributing network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server bears too much demand, improving application responsiveness and availability. Common algorithms include Round Robin (simple but doesn't consider server load), Least Connections (routes to servers with fewest active connections), and IP Hash (ensures user requests go to the same server). Layer 4 load balancing operates at the transport level and is faster but less flexible, while Layer 7 can make routing decisions based on HTTP headers or content. Modern load balancers provide health checks, SSL termination, and session persistence. For global applications, DNS-based global load balancing routes users to the nearest data center. Load balancers themselves can be a single point of failure, so redundant configurations are typically implemented for high availability.
