When discussing load balancing in system design, I'd explain that it's the process of distributing network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server bears too much demand. This improves application responsiveness and availability. I would outline common algorithms like Round Robin (simple but doesn't consider server load), Least Connections (routes to servers with fewest active connections), and IP Hash (ensures user requests go to the same server). Layer 4 load balancing operates at the transport level and is faster but less flexible, while Layer 7 can make routing decisions based on HTTP headers or content. I'd mention that modern load balancers provide health checks, SSL termination, and session persistence. For global applications, I'd discuss DNS-based global load balancing to route users to the nearest data center. Finally, I'd note that load balancers themselves can be a single point of failure, so redundant configurations are typically implemented.
