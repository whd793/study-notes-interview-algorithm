# CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the software delivery process from code changes to production deployment. Well-designed pipelines improve development velocity, code quality, and operational reliability while standardizing the release process.

The architecture consists of several stages: source control integration (detecting code changes), build automation (compiling and packaging), automated testing (validating changes), artifact management (storing build outputs), deployment automation (releasing to environments), and observability (monitoring pipeline and deployment health).

Source control workflows typically follow Git-based approaches like GitHub Flow (feature branches merged to main with pull requests), GitFlow (development and main branches with supporting branches), or trunk-based development (frequent merges to main with feature flags). Webhooks or polling trigger pipeline execution when changes are detected.

Build stages compile code, run static analysis, generate deployment artifacts, and produce metadata like version information and build provenance. Container-based builds using tools like Docker ensure consistent build environments regardless of the CI server. Caching dependencies and intermediate build artifacts significantly improves performance for large projects.

Testing phases typically include unit tests (validating individual components), integration tests (verifying component interactions), end-to-end tests (testing complete user journeys), and non-functional tests (performance, security). Test pyramids balance comprehensive coverage with execution time, with more extensive tests running in parallel to minimize pipeline duration.

Deployment strategies determine how changes reach production: blue-green deployments maintain parallel environments for zero-downtime switching; canary deployments expose changes to limited users before full rollout; progressive delivery uses feature flags to control functionality exposure regardless of deployment state. Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) ensures environment consistency across the pipeline.

Pipeline orchestration platforms like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or cloud-specific services coordinate these stages. Modern approaches favor declarative pipeline definitions stored alongside application code, enabling pipeline-as-code with versioning and review processes.

Manageability considerations include pipeline visualization (tracking progress and results), notification systems (alerting on failures), audit trails (documenting changes for compliance), and self-service capabilities (allowing developers to configure project-specific pipeline behaviors).

Advanced implementations include dynamic pipeline generation based on code changes, automatic rollback on metric degradation, and integration with approval workflows and change management systems for regulated environments.
