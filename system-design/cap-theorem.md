The CAP theorem states a distributed system cannot simultaneously provide all three guarantees: Consistency (all nodes see the same data at the same time), Availability (every request receives a response), and Partition tolerance (the system continues to operate despite network failures). Since network partitions are unavoidable in distributed systems, we must choose between consistency and availability. Traditional relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL) typically prioritize consistency over availability, while NoSQL databases make different trade-offs - Cassandra and DynamoDB favor availability, while MongoDB and HBase favor consistency. This isn't a binary choice but a spectrum, with many systems providing tunable consistency levels. In practice, most modern distributed systems use strategies like eventual consistency, quorum-based approaches, or conflict resolution techniques to provide appropriate trade-offs based on business requirements. Understanding these trade-offs is essential when designing systems that must scale across multiple servers or regions.
