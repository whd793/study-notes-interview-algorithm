# NoSQL Database Selection Criteria

NoSQL databases address limitations of traditional relational databases by offering alternative data models, horizontal scalability, and flexible schemas. Selecting the appropriate NoSQL solution depends on understanding the different types and their use cases.

Key-Value Stores (Redis, DynamoDB, etcd) excel at high-throughput, low-latency operations with simple access patterns based on primary keys. They're ideal for caching, session storage, real-time analytics, and storing configuration data, but limited for complex queries or relationships.

Document Databases (MongoDB, Couchbase, Firestore) store semi-structured data as documents (typically JSON), supporting flexible schemas and querying based on document contents. They're well-suited for content management, user profiles, event logging, and applications with evolving schemas, but may struggle with complex transactions across documents.

Column-Family Stores (Cassandra, HBase, ScyllaDB) organize data in column families optimized for queries over large datasets. They excel at time-series data, IoT applications, recommendation systems, and analytics workloads requiring high write throughput and horizontal scalability.

Graph Databases (Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, JanusGraph) specialize in representing and querying complex relationships. They're optimal for social networks, fraud detection, knowledge graphs, and recommendation engines where relationship traversal performance is critical.

When selecting a NoSQL database, critical factors include: query patterns (access patterns should align with database strengths), consistency requirements (strong vs. eventual consistency), scaling needs (read vs. write scaling), operational complexity, and development ecosystem. Many modern applications employ multiple database types in a polyglot persistence architecture, using each database for its particular strengths within different application components.
