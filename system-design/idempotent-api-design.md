# Idempotent API Design

Idempotent API operations produce the same result regardless of how many times they're called, which is crucial for building reliable systems that can handle retries and duplicate requests safely. Idempotency ensures consistent system state even when network issues, timeouts, or client retries occur.

HTTP methods have different idempotency characteristics: GET, HEAD, PUT, and DELETE should be idempotent according to HTTP specifications, while POST is typically non-idempotent. Making naturally non-idempotent operations idempotent requires explicit design.

Common implementation strategies include idempotency keys (client-generated unique identifiers included with each request), where servers store completed operation IDs and reject duplicates; conditional requests using If-Match or If-None-Match headers with ETags to prevent unintended updates; and deduplication windows, which track recent operations for a specific time period to detect duplicates.

For state-changing operations, designs should focus on effect idempotency rather than operation idempotency - multiple calls might process differently internally but should result in the same final system state. Database transactions can implement this using upsert operations or conditional updates.

Practical considerations include determining appropriate retention periods for idempotency records, handling storage cleanup, ensuring idempotency keys are properly generated by clients (UUID v4 is commonly used), and documenting idempotency guarantees clearly in API specifications.

Implementing idempotency adds complexity but is essential for mission-critical operations, especially in distributed systems with eventual consistency or in environments prone to network instability. Proper idempotent design prevents data corruption, duplicate records, and inconsistent states that would otherwise require manual intervention.
