Event-driven architecture is a design paradigm where the production, detection, consumption of, and reaction to events drive the system's components. Events represent a significant change in state and are typically published by service producers and consumed by service consumers through an event broker. The key benefit is loose coupling - producers don't need to know who consumes their events, enabling independent scaling and evolution. Patterns include publish-subscribe for broadcasting events to multiple consumers and event sourcing for storing the history of domain events as the system of record. Technologies like Kafka, RabbitMQ, or AWS EventBridge facilitate this architecture. While this approach offers improved scalability and resilience, challenges include ensuring event order, handling duplication, and maintaining data consistency. Event-driven systems excel for real-time processing, complex workflows, and situations where components need to react to changes without direct coupling.
