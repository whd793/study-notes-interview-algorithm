# API Versioning Strategies

API versioning is essential for evolving APIs while maintaining backward compatibility for existing clients. There are several approaches, each with different trade-offs.

URI Path Versioning involves including the version in the URL path (e.g., `/api/v1/products`). This approach is highly visible, easily testable in browsers, and simple to understand, but it violates REST principles by suggesting that the same resource exists at different URLs.

Query Parameter Versioning specifies the version as a query parameter (e.g., `/api/products?version=1`). This maintains a consistent resource URL and makes the version optional, but can be overlooked in documentation and complicates caching.

Header-Based Versioning uses custom HTTP headers (e.g., `Accept-Version: 1.0`) or content negotiation with the Accept header. This approach keeps URLs clean and aligns with HTTP standards, but is less visible and harder to test with simple tools.

Content Negotiation leverages the HTTP Accept header with custom media types (e.g., `Accept: application/vnd.company.app-v2+json`). This follows HTTP standards well but adds complexity and reduces visibility.

When implementing versioning, consider these best practices: version only when necessary for breaking changes, use semantic versioning to communicate change impact, maintain older versions for a documented period, provide migration guides between versions, and implement proper testing across all supported versions.

Additional considerations include designing for extensibility from the start (using fields that can accommodate future needs), employing feature flags for selective capability exposure, monitoring version usage to inform deprecation decisions, and communicating changes clearly through developer documentation and deprecation notices.
