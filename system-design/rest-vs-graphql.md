# REST vs GraphQL API Design

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods and status codes. It organizes resources into endpoints, with each endpoint representing a specific entity. REST APIs typically return fixed data structures and may require multiple requests to gather related data. They benefit from widespread adoption, statelessness, cacheability, and leveraging of HTTP standards. However, they can lead to over-fetching or under-fetching of data and require multiple endpoints for complex data needs.

GraphQL is a query language that allows clients to request exactly the data they need in a single request. It uses a single endpoint where clients specify the shape and structure of the response. GraphQL provides a strongly typed schema that serves as a contract between client and server, enabling powerful introspection capabilities. Benefits include reduced network requests, precise data fetching, and backward compatibility without versioning. Challenges include increased complexity in implementation, potential performance issues with deeply nested queries, and more complex caching strategies.

When choosing between them, REST is generally better for simple CRUD operations, public APIs with stable requirements, and when HTTP caching is important. GraphQL excels for complex data relationships, variable client data requirements, mobile applications with bandwidth constraints, and rapidly evolving APIs.

Many modern systems use a hybrid approach: REST for simple resource operations and GraphQL for complex data requirements. Some organizations expose both interfaces, allowing clients to choose the most appropriate for their needs. Implementation considerations include proper error handling, authentication mechanisms, rate limiting, performance optimization, and comprehensive documentation for either approach.
