For caching strategies in distributed systems, I'd start by explaining that caching improves performance by storing frequently accessed data in fast-access storage. I would outline key strategies like cache-aside (application checks cache first, then database), read-through/write-through (cache manages data access), and write-behind (asynchronous updates to database). I'd discuss important considerations including cache invalidation approaches, eviction policies like LRU or LFU, and time-to-live settings. For distributed systems, I'd mention the challenges of cache consistency and techniques like versioning or timestamps. I'd highlight how different caching layers serve different purposes - browser caching for UI assets, CDNs for static content, application caching for computed results, and database caching for query results. The appropriate strategy depends on the access patterns, consistency requirements, and scale of the system. When implemented properly, caching can dramatically reduce latency and database load.
