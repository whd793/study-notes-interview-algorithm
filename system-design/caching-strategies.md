Caching improves performance by storing frequently accessed data in fast-access storage. Key strategies include cache-aside (application checks cache first, then database), read-through/write-through (cache manages data access), and write-behind (asynchronous updates to database). Important considerations include cache invalidation approaches, eviction policies like LRU or LFU, and time-to-live settings. In distributed systems, cache consistency presents challenges addressed through versioning or timestamps. Different caching layers serve different purposes - browser caching for UI assets, CDNs for static content, application caching for computed results, and database caching for query results. The appropriate strategy depends on the access patterns, consistency requirements, and scale of the system. When implemented properly, caching dramatically reduces latency and database load while improving application responsiveness.
