When asked about distributed tracing, I'd describe it as a method for tracking and visualizing requests as they flow through distributed systems. It's crucial for understanding the end-to-end journey of requests across multiple services. I would explain key concepts like traces (representing full request paths), spans (operations within services), and context propagation (passing trace identifiers between services). I'd mention implementation approaches using tools like Jaeger, Zipkin, or AWS X-Ray, which typically require instrumentation of application code. Distributed tracing helps identify performance bottlenecks, troubleshoot failures, and understand service dependencies. I'd emphasize the importance of sampling strategies to manage the volume of trace data and the need for correlation with logs and metrics. When implementing tracing, standardized approaches like OpenTelemetry provide vendor-neutral instrumentation. For effective observability, distributed tracing should be combined with metrics and logging as part of a comprehensive monitoring strategy.
