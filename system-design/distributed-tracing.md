Distributed tracing is a method for tracking and visualizing requests as they flow through distributed systems, crucial for understanding the end-to-end journey of requests across multiple services. Key concepts include traces (representing full request paths), spans (operations within services), and context propagation (passing trace identifiers between services). Implementation approaches use tools like Jaeger, Zipkin, or AWS X-Ray, which typically require instrumentation of application code. Distributed tracing helps identify performance bottlenecks, troubleshoot failures, and understand service dependencies. Sampling strategies manage the volume of trace data, and correlation with logs and metrics is essential. Standardized approaches like OpenTelemetry provide vendor-neutral instrumentation. For effective observability, distributed tracing should be combined with metrics and logging as part of a comprehensive monitoring strategy to give a complete picture of system behavior.
