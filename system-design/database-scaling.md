Database scaling involves two main strategies: vertical and horizontal scaling. Vertical scaling (scaling up) adds more resources to existing servers, which is simpler but has physical limitations. Horizontal scaling (scaling out) adds more database servers, which is more complex but offers better scalability. Read replicas handle read-heavy workloads while database sharding distributes data across multiple servers. Sharding requires careful key selection and can complicate queries that span multiple shards. NoSQL solutions offer built-in horizontal scaling capabilities but involve trade-offs in consistency or query flexibility. Caching strategies using Redis or Memcached reduce database load. When implementing any scaling solution, proper monitoring is crucial to identify bottlenecks early and ensure optimal performance as the system grows.
