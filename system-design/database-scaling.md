For database scaling approaches, I'd explain that there are two main strategies: vertical and horizontal scaling. Vertical scaling (scaling up) involves adding more resources to existing servers, which is simpler but has physical limitations. Horizontal scaling (scaling out) involves adding more database servers, which is more complex but offers better scalability. I would discuss read replicas for handling read-heavy workloads and database sharding for distributing data across multiple servers. I'd mention that sharding requires careful key selection and can complicate queries that span multiple shards. For NoSQL solutions, I'd highlight their built-in horizontal scaling capabilities but trade-offs in consistency or query flexibility. I'd also touch on caching strategies using Redis or Memcached to reduce database load, and when implementing any scaling solution, it's crucial to have proper monitoring to identify bottlenecks early.
