Microservices architecture is an approach where an application is built as a collection of small, loosely coupled services. Each service runs in its own process and communicates through lightweight mechanisms like HTTP APIs. The key benefits include independent deployability, technology diversity, and better fault isolation. Services can be scaled independently based on demand, and teams can work autonomously on different services. However, this architecture introduces increased complexity in deployment, monitoring, and maintaining data consistency across services. Proper service boundaries should follow business domains as recommended by Domain-Driven Design principles. For large-scale applications with diverse requirements, microservices provide significant advantages, but for smaller applications, the overhead might outweigh the benefits.
