# Logs and Monitoring System Design

Logs and monitoring systems collect, process, and analyze operational data from applications and infrastructure to provide visibility into system behavior, performance, and health. These systems enable troubleshooting, performance optimization, capacity planning, and anomaly detection.

The architecture consists of data collection components (gathering metrics, logs, and traces), transport mechanisms (moving data efficiently), storage systems (organizing and retaining data), processing engines (analyzing and aggregating), visualization tools (presenting insights), and alerting systems (notifying about issues).

Metrics collection captures numerical measurements of system behavior, typically following a dimensional data model with measurement names, timestamp values, and key-value labels for context. Collection occurs through pull models (where collectors scrape endpoints) or push models (where applications send data to receivers). Time-series databases like Prometheus, InfluxDB, or Timestream provide efficient storage and query capabilities for this data.

Log collection aggregates text-based records of events from applications, services, and infrastructure components. Modern approaches use structured logging with consistent formats (typically JSON) to enable easier parsing and analysis. Log pipelines often include processing stages for parsing, filtering, enrichment, and normalization before storage in systems like Elasticsearch, Loki, or cloud logging services.

Distributed tracing tracks requests as they flow through microservices, capturing timing, dependencies, and context. Implementations following the OpenTelemetry standard use trace identifiers and span IDs to correlate activities across service boundaries. Storage systems for traces require efficient querying by trace ID and various attributes for troubleshooting complex interactions.

Data retention strategies balance storage costs against analysis needs through tiered approaches: high-resolution recent data for operational troubleshooting; downsampled or aggregated data for medium-term analysis; and summarized data for long-term trends. Retention policies typically vary by data importance and regulatory requirements.

Visualization and analysis tools provide dashboards (for operational monitoring), exploratory interfaces (for investigation), and correlation capabilities (connecting related signals). Effective dashboards present key indicators at appropriate granularity with drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis when problems arise.

Alerting systems detect problematic conditions through threshold-based rules, statistical anomaly detection, or machine learning models. Alert design requires careful attention to signal-to-noise ratio, actionability, routing to appropriate responders, and alert fatigue prevention through aggregation and suppression mechanisms.

Scalability considerations include handling high-cardinality data (metrics with many unique label combinations), efficient compression for log storage, sampling strategies for high-volume traces, and distributed processing for analysis workloads. Cloud-based implementations often leverage managed services for each component while maintaining integration across the observability stack.
