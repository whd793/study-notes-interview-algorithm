# High-Availability Database Design

High-availability database systems aim to provide continuous operation without service interruption, even during hardware failures, network issues, or maintenance activities. These systems balance consistency, availability, and partition tolerance according to application requirements.

The fundamental architecture employs redundancy at multiple levels: server redundancy through database replication, component redundancy (redundant network paths, power supplies, disks), and geographical redundancy across multiple data centers or availability zones.

Primary-replica (master-slave) replication configurations maintain one writable primary node with multiple read replicas. Synchronous replication ensures consistency but may impact performance, while asynchronous replication improves performance at the cost of potential data loss during failures. Multi-master configurations allow writes to any node but introduce complex conflict resolution requirements.

Automated failover mechanisms detect primary node failures and promote a replica to primary status. This involves health monitoring services, leader election protocols, and DNS or proxy layer updates to redirect clients. Recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO) metrics define acceptable downtime and data loss limits.

Connection management uses connection pooling and load balancers with health checks to route traffic only to operational nodes. Read-write splitting directs read queries to replicas while sending writes to the primary, distributing load and improving read scalability.

Data durability ensures information survives hardware failures through techniques like write-ahead logging (WAL), redundant storage, and point-in-time recovery capabilities. Backup strategies combine full backups with incremental changes and transaction logs for complete recoverability.

Geographically distributed deployments use multi-region replication to protect against datacenter-level failures. Active-passive configurations maintain standby environments in secondary regions, while active-active setups serve traffic from multiple regions simultaneously with bidirectional replication.

Operational considerations include implementing non-disruptive maintenance procedures, automated monitoring with alerting, practicing failover drills regularly, maintaining detailed runbooks for recovery scenarios, and conducting thorough post-incident analysis after availability events.
