# OAuth 2.0 Implementation Design

OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that enables third-party applications to obtain limited access to a user's account on a server without sharing credentials. It addresses the challenge of allowing secure delegated access to resources by separating the role of the client from the resource owner.

The four primary roles in OAuth 2.0 are: Resource Owner (the user), Client (the application requesting access), Authorization Server (issues access tokens), and Resource Server (hosts protected resources). The core grant types include: Authorization Code (for server-side applications), Implicit (for browser-based or mobile apps), Resource Owner Password Credentials (for trusted applications), and Client Credentials (for machine-to-machine communication).

When implementing OAuth 2.0, key architectural decisions include token format (JWT vs. opaque tokens), token storage (database vs. self-contained), and handling of token validation and revocation. Security considerations must include implementing PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for public clients, using short-lived access tokens with refresh tokens, enforcing TLS for all communications, and validating redirect URIs against a whitelist.

For microservices architectures, centralized authorization servers like Keycloak, Auth0, or AWS Cognito can manage authentication while individual services validate tokens and implement fine-grained authorization. API gateways often handle token validation, reducing implementation complexity in individual services.

Common challenges include implementing proper token validation, managing token scope effectively, handling session state, implementing logout functionality across applications, and balancing security with user experience. When designed properly, OAuth 2.0 provides a secure authorization mechanism that scales well for modern distributed applications.
