# Distributed Caching

Distributed caching is a technique that stores frequently accessed data across multiple cache servers to improve application performance and scalability. Unlike local caching, distributed caching maintains cache coherence across multiple application instances or services in a distributed system.

The primary benefits include reduced database load, improved response times, and better horizontal scalability. Popular implementations include Redis and Memcached, with Redis offering additional data structures and persistence options.

When implementing distributed caching, key considerations include cache consistency models (strong vs. eventual consistency), eviction policies (LRU, LFU, FIFO), and data partitioning strategies. For partitioning, consistent hashing is commonly used to distribute cache entries while minimizing redistribution during scaling events.

Cache invalidation strategies are essential - common approaches include TTL-based expiration, write-through (update cache and database simultaneously), and cache-aside (application manages cache population). System-wide cache invalidation can be implemented using pub/sub mechanisms or versioning strategies.

In microservices architectures, each service typically manages its own cache access, with careful consideration given to data ownership boundaries. For global applications, multi-region caching with replication adds complexity but reduces user latency. Proper monitoring and observability (hit/miss ratios, memory usage, eviction rates) are critical for maintaining optimal cache performance.
