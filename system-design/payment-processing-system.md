# Payment Processing System Design

Payment processing systems facilitate financial transactions between customers, merchants, and financial institutions. These systems must prioritize security, reliability, and compliance while maintaining high availability and transaction integrity.

The architecture consists of several key components: payment gateways (interfacing with card networks and banks), merchant integration services (APIs for businesses), payment orchestration (transaction routing and processing), fraud detection systems, and reconciliation/settlement services.

Transaction flow typically begins with payment collection through various channels (web, mobile, POS). The system tokenizes sensitive payment data, validates the transaction, performs fraud checks, routes to appropriate payment processors, and handles responses including success, failure, or additional authentication requirements.

Payment orchestration enables intelligent routing between multiple payment processors based on factors like cost, success rates, and geographical optimization. This multi-provider approach improves resilience against processor outages and optimizes transaction costs and approval rates.

Idempotency is critical throughout the system to prevent duplicate charges during network issues or retries. This requires unique idempotency keys for transactions and careful state management to ensure consistency even with communication failures.

Fraud prevention incorporates rule-based systems and machine learning models analyzing transaction patterns, user behavior, device fingerprinting, and network information. Risk scoring determines whether to approve, decline, or flag transactions for additional verification.

Security considerations include PCI DSS compliance for handling card data, tokenization to minimize sensitive data exposure, end-to-end encryption, and secure key management. Authentication methods like 3D Secure add additional verification layers for high-risk transactions.

Scalability challenges include handling transaction spikes during sales events, maintaining low latency for real-time approvals (typically <2 seconds), and ensuring database consistency across distributed systems. Architecture often employs CQRS patterns separating transaction processing from reporting and analytics workloads.

Reconciliation processes match transactions with financial settlements, identifying discrepancies for resolution. This includes handling refunds, chargebacks, failed transactions, and accounting integration.
