# Data Warehouse Architecture Design

Data warehouses are specialized database systems optimized for analytics and reporting on large datasets from multiple sources. They transform operational data into structured formats that support complex queries and business intelligence.

The core architectural components include data ingestion pipelines, staging areas, the primary storage layer, and serving layers for various query patterns. Modern data warehouses typically implement either Kimball (dimensional modeling with conformed dimensions), Inmon (normalized enterprise model with dependent data marts), or Data Vault (highly flexible hub-and-spoke approach) methodologies.

Data modeling approaches focus on analytics efficiency rather than transactional integrity. Star schemas with denormalized dimension tables and normalized fact tables optimize for query performance and understandability. Snowflake schemas introduce normalization in dimension tables for reduced redundancy at the cost of join complexity.

The storage layer typically employs columnar formats (Parquet, ORC) which dramatically improve analytical query performance through compression, predicate pushdown, and column pruning. Partitioning strategies based on common query dimensions (date, region, category) reduce the data scanned for typical queries.

Query optimization techniques include materialized views (precomputed aggregates), query result caching, predicate optimization, and parallel execution across distributed nodes. MPP (Massively Parallel Processing) architectures distribute both storage and computation to handle petabyte-scale datasets.

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) or ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipelines maintain data freshness. Modern approaches favor ELT with transformation in the warehouse itself, leveraging its processing capabilities. Data quality checks, schema evolution handling, and lineage tracking are essential pipeline components.

Cloud data warehouses like Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, and Google BigQuery offer separation of storage and compute resources, enabling independent scaling and pay-per-use pricing models. This architectural shift supports concurrent workloads with varying resource requirements without over-provisioning.
