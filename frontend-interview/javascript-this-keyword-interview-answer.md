# JavaScript 'this' Keyword Interview Answer

The 'this' keyword in JavaScript refers to the object that is executing the current function, but its value is determined by how the function is called, not where it's defined. In a regular function, 'this' depends on the call context: it refers to the global object when called directly (window in browsers, global in Node.js), to the object when called as a method, to the new instance when used with constructor functions, and can be explicitly set using call(), apply(), or bind().

Arrow functions, however, don't have their own 'this' bindingâ€”they inherit 'this' from the surrounding lexical context where they're defined. I use arrow functions for callbacks within class methods or event handlers to preserve the original 'this' context, avoiding the need for manual binding.

Common pitfalls I've learned to avoid include losing 'this' context in callbacks, trying to access 'this' in nested functions, and forgetting that strict mode changes default 'this' binding from the global object to undefined. Understanding these nuances is essential for effective JavaScript development.
