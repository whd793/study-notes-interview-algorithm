# Responsive Design Interview Answer

Responsive design is an approach to web development that creates websites that adapt to different devices and screen sizes. I implement responsive design using three core techniques: fluid layouts using percentage-based widths instead of fixed pixels; flexible images that scale appropriately within their containers; and media queries to apply different styles based on device characteristics.

In my workflow, I typically start with a mobile-first approach, designing for smaller screens initially and then progressively enhancing the layout for larger devices. This ensures good performance on mobile devices where resources may be constrained.

For complex layouts, I leverage modern CSS tools like Flexbox for one-dimensional layouts, Grid for two-dimensional layouts, and relative units like rem, em, and viewport units rather than absolute pixels. I also prioritize performance by optimizing images for different screen sizes using the picture element and srcset attributes.
