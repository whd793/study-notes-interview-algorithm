# React Hooks Interview Answer

React Hooks are functions that let you use state and lifecycle features in functional components without classes. The most common hooks I use are useState for managing state, useEffect for side effects like data fetching, useContext for accessing context, and useRef for maintaining references.

Hooks solved several problems in React development, including complex component hierarchies, difficulty reusing stateful logic, and confusing class components. They make code more readable because they group related logic together rather than splitting it across lifecycle methods.

I also create custom hooks to extract and reuse logic across components. For example, I might build a useLocalStorage hook to persist state in localStorage, or a useWindowSize hook to track browser dimensions for responsive features.
