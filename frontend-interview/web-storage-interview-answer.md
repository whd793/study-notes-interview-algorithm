# Web Storage Technologies Interview Answer

Browsers offer several options for client-side storage, each with different use cases. I select the appropriate storage technology based on the data type, size, and persistence requirements.

LocalStorage provides simple key-value storage (5-10MB) that persists across browser sessions. I use it for user preferences, theme settings, and non-sensitive application state. SessionStorage is similar but limited to the current tab/window session, making it useful for temporary form data or wizard states.

For more complex data or larger storage needs, IndexedDB offers an object-oriented database with support for transactions, indexes, and storing virtually any type of JavaScript object. I use it for offline data caching, client-side data manipulation before submission, or applications that need to work without a network connection.

Cookies are primarily for server communication but can store small amounts of data (4KB). I only use them for authentication tokens or session identifiers, always setting appropriate flags like HttpOnly for sensitive data and SameSite for CSRF protection. For all storage methods, I'm careful about security implications and privacy regulations like GDPR.
