# JavaScript Design Patterns Interview Answer

Design patterns provide tested solutions to common programming problems. In JavaScript development, I apply several patterns depending on the specific needs of each application.

The Module pattern (or its ES6 equivalent using actual modules) helps create private and public methods, preventing global namespace pollution. For creating flexible object instances, I use the Factory pattern when I need simple object creation and the Builder pattern for objects with complex configurations.

When implementing state management, I often use the Observer pattern, which is the foundation of event-driven systems like React's state updates or pub/sub implementations. For cross-component communication in vanilla JS applications, I implement a centralized Event Bus/Mediator pattern to reduce direct dependencies between components.

To manage performance with expensive operations, I apply the Singleton pattern to ensure only one instance exists throughout the application, and the Proxy pattern to add control over access to objects, which is useful for validation, logging, or lazy initialization. These patterns help me write more maintainable, scalable, and efficient code.
