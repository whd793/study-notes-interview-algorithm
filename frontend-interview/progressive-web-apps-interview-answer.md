# Progressive Web Apps Interview Answer

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) combine the best aspects of web and native applications. The key features I implement when building PWAs include offline functionality using Service Workers, installability with a Web App Manifest, responsive design for all device types, and push notifications for re-engagement.

Service Workers are a critical component that acts as a proxy between the web app, the browser, and the network. I use them to cache assets and API responses, enabling offline functionality and improving performance even with a slow connection. I implement different caching strategies depending on the type of resource - for example, a cache-first approach for static assets but a network-first approach for frequently updated API data.

For the installation experience, I create a manifest.json file with the appropriate icons, colors, and display modes, then ensure the app meets installability criteria like being served over HTTPS and registering a Service Worker. I also implement an app shell architecture to provide immediate visual feedback while dynamic content loads.

Measuring PWA performance is essential, so I track metrics like Time to Interactive and First Contentful Paint using Lighthouse and real user monitoring.
