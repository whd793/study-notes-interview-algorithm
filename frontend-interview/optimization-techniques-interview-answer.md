# Frontend Optimization Techniques Interview Answer

Optimizing frontend performance requires a multifaceted approach addressing different aspects of the application. For initial load performance, I focus on reducing the critical rendering path by minimizing render-blocking resources, implementing code splitting with dynamic imports to load only what's needed, and using resource hints like preconnect and preload to prioritize important resources.

For runtime performance, I optimize rendering by avoiding unnecessary rerenders in React components using memoization techniques like React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback. I'm careful to avoid layout thrashing by batching DOM reads and writes, and I use virtualization techniques for long lists to render only visible items.

Image optimization is crucial, so I implement responsive images with srcset and sizes attributes, modern formats like WebP and AVIF, and lazy loading for off-screen content. I also implement font optimization strategies like font-display: swap and preloading critical fonts to prevent layout shifts and improve perceived performance.

I continuously measure performance using tools like Lighthouse and Web Vitals, focusing particularly on Core Web Vitals metrics which directly impact user experience and SEO.
