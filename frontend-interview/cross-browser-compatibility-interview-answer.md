# Cross-Browser Compatibility Interview Answer

Ensuring cross-browser compatibility means delivering a consistent experience across different browsers and devices. My approach starts with using feature detection rather than browser detection, testing in multiple browsers regularly, and having a solid understanding of browser-specific quirks.

I use tools like Babel to transpile modern JavaScript to more widely supported versions, and PostCSS with Autoprefixer to handle vendor prefixes automatically. For CSS, I maintain a baseline of core functionality that works everywhere, then progressively enhance the experience for browsers that support modern features using feature queries (@supports).

When browser-specific issues arise, I consult caniuse.com to understand support levels and identify polyfills if needed. For complex applications, I implement a testing strategy that includes automated testing across multiple browsers using services like BrowserStack or Sauce Labs. I also analyze analytics to ensure I'm focusing on the browsers my actual users are using rather than trying to support every possible browser.
