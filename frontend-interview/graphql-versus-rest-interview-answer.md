# GraphQL vs REST Interview Answer

GraphQL and REST are different approaches to building APIs, each with distinct advantages. REST organizes endpoints around resources with standard HTTP methods, while GraphQL provides a single endpoint where clients specify exactly what data they need.

The main advantages I've experienced with GraphQL include eliminating over-fetching by requesting only needed fields, reducing under-fetching through the ability to retrieve related data in a single request, and providing stronger typing with a schema that serves as both documentation and validation. This flexibility is particularly valuable for applications with complex data requirements or where bandwidth efficiency is important.

However, REST has its strengths in simplicity, widespread adoption, and better caching through HTTP cache mechanisms. When implementing GraphQL in frontend applications, I typically use Apollo Client which provides features like normalized caching, optimistic UI updates, and integration with React component lifecycles. The decision between GraphQL and REST ultimately depends on project requirements, existing infrastructure, and team expertise.
