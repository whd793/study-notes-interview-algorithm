# Testing Frontend Applications Interview Answer

Frontend testing is essential for ensuring application quality and preventing regressions. I implement a testing pyramid approach with three main levels: unit tests for individual functions and components, integration tests for interactions between components, and end-to-end tests for critical user flows.

For unit testing React components, I use Jest as the test runner and React Testing Library to test components from the user's perspective. I focus on testing behavior rather than implementation details, which makes tests more resilient to refactoring. For example, I verify that clicking a button shows a dropdown menu rather than testing that a state variable changed.

For integration testing, I test how multiple components work together, often with mock API responses. For end-to-end testing, I use Cypress to automate user flows in a real browser environment. I also implement visual regression testing for UI components using tools like Percy or Chromatic to catch unexpected visual changes.

Beyond functional testing, I use tools like Lighthouse for performance testing and axe for accessibility testing to ensure a high-quality user experience across all dimensions.
