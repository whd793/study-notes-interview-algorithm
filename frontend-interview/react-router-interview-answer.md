# React Router Interview Answer

React Router enables navigation and routing in React applications by rendering different components based on the URL without full page reloads. I implement it by wrapping my application in a Router component (BrowserRouter for browsers with History API support or HashRouter for older browsers), then defining routes with Route components that map URL patterns to specific components.

For dynamic routes with parameters, I use path patterns like '/user/:id' and access these parameters in components via the useParams hook. I handle nested routes by nesting Route components, which is particularly useful for complex layouts with persistent sections and changing content areas. For programmatic navigation, I use the useNavigate hook or the Navigate component to redirect users based on certain conditions.

Protected routes that require authentication are implemented by creating wrapper components that check authentication status and either render the requested component or redirect to a login page. I also implement proper 404 handling with a catch-all route at the end of my route definitions, and use the Outlet component from React Router v6 to define where child routes should render within parent components.
