# JavaScript Testing Interview Answer

Effective JavaScript testing requires a combination of different testing types. I implement unit tests for individual functions and components, using Jest as my test runner and assertion library because of its snapshot capabilities, mocking features, and coverage reporting. For React components, I use React Testing Library which encourages testing behavior rather than implementation details.

I follow the AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert) to structure tests clearly: setting up the test environment, performing the action being tested, and verifying the expected outcome. For mocking dependencies like API calls, I use Jest's mock functions or libraries like MSW (Mock Service Worker) that intercept network requests.

Integration tests verify that different parts of the application work together correctly. I test key user flows and component interactions, focusing on what matters to users rather than implementation specifics. For end-to-end testing, I use tools like Cypress or Playwright to automate browser interactions, testing the application from a user's perspective.

I prioritize test reliability by avoiding implementation details, using data-testid attributes for selection when necessary, and ensuring tests are deterministic by properly mocking time-dependent operations.
