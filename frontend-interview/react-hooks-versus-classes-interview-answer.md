# React Hooks vs Class Components Interview Answer

The shift from class components to hooks represents a fundamental change in how React components are structured. Class components manage lifecycle and state through methods like componentDidMount and this.setState, while hooks handle this through functions like useState and useEffect.

Hooks offer several advantages: they make stateful logic reusable through custom hooks, eliminate the confusion around 'this' binding in JavaScript classes, and group related code by concern rather than lifecycle method. This results in more readable and maintainable components, especially as they grow in complexity.

Class components still have some unique capabilities, like error boundaries, but most React development has moved toward hooks for new code. When migrating legacy class components, I follow a gradual approach, converting simpler components first and using the useState hook for direct state equivalents, while useEffect replaces lifecycle methods. The key mental shift is thinking in terms of synchronization with effects rather than lifecycle events that happen at specific times.
