# React Hooks Implementation Interview Answer

React Hooks are built on a powerful concept of maintaining an internal state array for each component. When I implement custom hooks, I keep in mind that each hook's state is isolated to its specific component instance and relies on the call order, which is why hooks can't be called conditionally.

I create custom hooks by extracting stateful logic from components into reusable functions. For example, a useFetch hook encapsulates data fetching, loading states, and error handling that would otherwise be duplicated across components. I ensure custom hooks follow the 'use' naming convention and compose them from existing React hooks like useState and useEffect.

When managing effects, I'm careful about the dependency array in useEffect to prevent infinite loops or stale closures. For complex state logic, I prefer useReducer over multiple useState calls, as it centralizes related state transitions. I use useCallback for event handlers that are passed to child components to prevent unnecessary renders, and useMemo for expensive calculations that shouldn't be recomputed on every render.
