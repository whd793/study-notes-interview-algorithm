# CSS Grid Interview Answer

CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that enables precise control over both rows and columns simultaneously. Unlike Flexbox which works on a single axis, Grid gives me complete control over item placement in both dimensions.

I use Grid when building complex page layouts, card systems, or any design where elements need to align both horizontally and vertically. The properties I use most are grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows to define track sizes, grid-gap for spacing, and grid-template-areas for named template regions.

The most powerful features are the fractional unit (fr) for flexible space distribution, the minmax() function to set size constraints, and auto-fill/auto-fit values for responsive layouts without media queries. For example, grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr)) creates a responsive grid that automatically adds or removes columns as the viewport changes.
