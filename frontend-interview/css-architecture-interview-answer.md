# CSS Architecture Interview Answer

CSS architecture involves organizing styles in a way that's scalable, maintainable, and prevents specificity conflicts. I typically use a combination of methodologies depending on the project size and team preferences.

For component-based applications, I prefer BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) naming conventions to create clear relationships between components and their parts. This approach encapsulates styles and reduces the risk of unintended style leakage. In React applications, I often use CSS Modules or styled-components to scope styles to specific components, eliminating global namespace concerns.

I organize CSS files following either a feature-first structure (grouping styles with their related components) or a type-based structure (separating base styles, components, utilities). Critical to any architecture is establishing naming conventions, variable systems for colors and spacing, and consistent patterns for responsive designs. I also implement a utility-first approach for one-off styling needs, keeping the number of custom CSS classes minimal.
