# Semantic HTML Interview Answer

Semantic HTML uses elements that clearly describe their meaning and purpose, like <header>, <nav>, and <footer>, instead of generic <div> tags. It improves accessibility by providing context to screen readers, enhances SEO by helping search engines understand content structure, and makes code more readable for developers.

When I build websites, I always choose the most appropriate semantic elements for content because it creates a stronger foundation for styling, accessibility, and future browser features. For example, I'd use <button> instead of a styled <div> because it provides keyboard accessibility and screen reader support automatically.

The key benefits include better accessibility, improved SEO rankings, cleaner code that's easier to maintain, and a more solid foundation for responsive design techniques.
