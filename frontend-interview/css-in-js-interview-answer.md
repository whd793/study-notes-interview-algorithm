# CSS-in-JS Interview Answer

CSS-in-JS refers to techniques for writing CSS directly in JavaScript files, offering component-scoped styling that eliminates global namespace issues. I've worked with several CSS-in-JS libraries, each with different approaches and trade-offs.

Styled-components uses tagged template literals to define component styles, creating actual components with the styles attached. This results in very readable code with the familiar CSS syntax, plus the ability to pass props to dynamically change styles based on component state.

Emotion provides similar capabilities but with more flexibility in its API, allowing both the styled approach and a css prop for direct styling. I find this particularly useful when transitioning existing projects as it can be adopted incrementally.

The main benefits I've experienced with CSS-in-JS include automatic critical CSS extraction, no class name collisions, dynamic styling based on props, and cleaner component code by co-locating styles with components. However, I'm aware of the runtime performance costs compared to traditional CSS, so I evaluate whether it's appropriate based on project requirements and team preferences.
