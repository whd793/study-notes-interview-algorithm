# React Forms Interview Answer

Building forms in React requires managing input elements while keeping React's state as the single source of truth. I implement forms using two main approaches: controlled and uncontrolled components. With controlled components, React state manages each form input's value through onChange handlers, giving complete control over validation, formatting, and conditional logic.

For complex forms, I use libraries like Formik or React Hook Form to reduce boilerplate while maintaining the benefits of controlled forms. These libraries handle common tasks like tracking touched fields, managing validation, and organizing form submission. I often pair them with schema validation libraries like Yup or Zod for declarative validation rules.

Accessibility is a key consideration in my form implementations. I ensure proper label associations with form controls, implement clear error messaging, maintain keyboard navigability, and use aria attributes when needed. For server interactions, I implement optimistic UI updates when appropriate, showing success states immediately while the request processes in the background, with fallback handling for failures.

I also build form components as reusable abstractions with consistent styling, validation, and behavior across the application, rather than implementing form logic repeatedly.
