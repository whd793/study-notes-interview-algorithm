# JavaScript Generators and Async Functions Interview Answer

Generators and async functions provide elegant solutions for managing asynchronous code in JavaScript. Generators are functions that can pause and resume execution, yielding values with the yield keyword and accepting input when resumed. This makes them powerful for controlling asynchronous flow, especially when combined with promises.

Before async/await became standard, libraries like co used generators with promises to create readable asynchronous code. The pattern involves yielding promises and having a runner function that handles each promise's resolution before continuing the generator. This approach laid the groundwork for the async/await syntax, which is essentially syntactic sugar over generators and promises.

Async functions, marked with the async keyword, automatically return promises and allow the use of await to pause execution until a promise resolves. This provides synchronous-looking code flow while maintaining asynchronous execution. I find this particularly valuable for sequential operations like API requests that depend on previous results, or for implementing retry logic with cleaner control flow than promise chains.

Generators still have unique use cases that async/await doesn't cover, like generating infinite sequences lazily or implementing complex state machines with bidirectional communication.
