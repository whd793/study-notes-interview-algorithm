# JavaScript Prototypes Interview Answer

Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another. Every JavaScript object has a prototype property which is a reference to another object. When a property is accessed on an object and not found, JavaScript automatically looks for it in the prototype, creating a chain of lookups known as the prototype chain.

Before ES6 classes, I worked directly with prototypes using constructor functions. For example, creating a Person constructor function and adding methods to Person.prototype ensures all instances share those methods without duplicating them in memory. This prototype-based inheritance is more memory-efficient than copying methods to each instance.

ES6 classes provide a more familiar syntax for working with prototypes, but it's important to understand they're syntactic sugar over the prototype system. When I use the extends keyword in a class declaration, it's setting up the prototype chain behind the scenes. I find understanding prototypes essential for advanced JavaScript patterns, debugging complex inheritance issues, and optimizing performance in object-heavy applications.
