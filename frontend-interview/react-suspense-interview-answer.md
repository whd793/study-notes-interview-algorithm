# React Suspense Interview Answer

React Suspense is a feature that allows components to "wait" for something before rendering, enabling better handling of asynchronous operations like data fetching and code splitting. I've primarily used Suspense for code splitting with React.lazy(), which lets me load components on demand rather than including everything in the initial bundle.

The key concept behind Suspense is that it catches components that "suspend" rendering while waiting for data or code to load, showing a fallback UI until they're ready. This creates a more declarative way to handle loading states compared to conditional rendering patterns.

In newer React versions, Suspense is being expanded for data fetching, allowing components to declare their data dependencies and automatically show loading states while that data loads. This approach moves loading logic out of individual components and into the framework itself. When implementing Suspense, I consider the user experience during loading periods, designing meaningful fallback components rather than generic loading spinners when possible.
