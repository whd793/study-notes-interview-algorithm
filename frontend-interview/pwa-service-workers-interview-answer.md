# PWA Service Workers Interview Answer

Service Workers are JavaScript files that run separately from the main browser thread, acting as a programmable network proxy between web applications, the browser, and the network. They're fundamental to Progressive Web Apps, enabling offline functionality, background syncing, and push notifications.

I implement Service Workers by registering them from the main JavaScript file, then setting up the install, activate, and fetch event handlers. During installation, I cache critical assets for the application shell. In the fetch handler, I implement caching strategies based on the resource type - for example, a cache-first strategy for static assets, network-first for API calls that need fresh data, and stale-while-revalidate for resources where showing something immediately is important but updates are also valuable.

Service Workers require careful implementation, particularly around cache versioning and updates. I manage this by using versioned cache names and clearing old caches during the activate event, ensuring users get updated assets after a new Service Worker is installed.
