# CSS Flexbox Interview Answer

Flexbox is a one-dimensional CSS layout model designed for arranging items in rows or columns. I use it whenever I need flexible distribution of space, powerful alignment capabilities, or responsive components that adapt to different screen sizes.

The key properties I work with are display: flex on the container, flex-direction to set the main axis, justify-content for alignment along the main axis, and align-items for the cross axis. What makes flexbox so powerful is how it handles space distribution with properties like flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis.

I find flexbox particularly useful for navigation bars, card layouts, form controls, and centering content both horizontally and vertically. It's also excellent for building components that need to switch from horizontal to vertical layouts at different breakpoints.
