# JavaScript Promises Interview Answer

Promises in JavaScript are objects representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. They help manage asynchronous code more cleanly than callbacks by providing a standardized way to handle future values and errors.

A Promise exists in one of three states: pending (initial state), fulfilled (operation completed successfully), or rejected (operation failed). I work with Promises using .then() for success handling, .catch() for error handling, and .finally() for cleanup regardless of outcome.

The Promise API also offers powerful composition tools I frequently use: Promise.all() for handling multiple promises in parallel and waiting for all to complete; Promise.race() to respond as soon as the first promise settles; and Promise.allSettled() to wait for all promises to complete regardless of success or failure. These patterns are essential when coordinating multiple asynchronous operations.
