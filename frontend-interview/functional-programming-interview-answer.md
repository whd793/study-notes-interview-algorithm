# Functional Programming in JavaScript Interview Answer

Functional programming is a paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. In JavaScript, I apply functional principles through pure functions, immutability, higher-order functions, and function composition.

Pure functions always return the same output for the same input and have no side effects, making code more predictable and testable. I work with immutable data by avoiding direct mutations and instead creating new copies with changes, often using the spread operator or libraries like Immer when working with complex objects.

JavaScript's array methods like map, filter, and reduce are powerful tools I use for functional transformations. Instead of imperative loops with accumulator variables, I prefer declarative patterns that clearly express what the code is doing rather than how it's doing it. For more complex operations, I compose functions together, passing the output of one function as the input to the next, creating data transformation pipelines.
