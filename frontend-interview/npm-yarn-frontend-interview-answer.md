# NPM and Yarn in Frontend Development Interview Answer

NPM (Node Package Manager) and Yarn are package managers for JavaScript that help manage project dependencies. Both tools read from package.json to install the required libraries and their dependencies, maintaining the node_modules directory.

I use these tools not just for dependency management but also for running scripts defined in package.json, which standardizes common tasks like starting the development server, running tests, or building for production. This creates consistent workflows across team members regardless of their local environments.

Yarn was created to address some of NPM's early issues like inconsistent installations and performance. While NPM has since improved significantly, Yarn still offers some distinct features I appreciate, like Plug'n'Play for eliminating node_modules, and Workspaces for managing monorepos. For lock files, NPM uses package-lock.json while Yarn uses yarn.lock, both serving to ensure reproducible builds by recording exact versions and dependency trees.

Beyond basic usage, I implement security practices like regular vulnerability checks with npm audit or yarn audit, and I'm careful about dependency management to avoid bloated bundles.
