# JavaScript Closures Interview Answer

A closure in JavaScript happens when a function remembers and can access its lexical scope even after the function has finished executing. In simpler terms, it's a function that can access variables from its outer scope even when executed elsewhere.

Closures are created automatically whenever a function is defined inside another function. They're extremely useful for data privacy, creating function factories, and maintaining state in asynchronous operations.

A practical example I often use is creating a counter function that maintains its count between calls without exposing the variable directly. This pattern helps me implement private variables, create factory functions with preset configurations, and manage state in event handlers that need to access component data.
