# JavaScript Generators Interview Answer

Generator functions in JavaScript provide a powerful way to create iterators that can pause and resume execution. Unlike regular functions that run to completion, generators use the yield keyword to return values and pause execution until the next() method is called again, maintaining their internal state between calls.

I use generators for several purposes: creating custom iterators that produce sequences on demand rather than storing everything in memory, implementing asynchronous operations with more readable control flow than promise chains, and managing state machines where the generator represents different states of a process.

Generators can receive values through next() calls, allowing two-way communication. This enables patterns like async/await implementation under the hood. When combined with Promises, generators provide a foundation for asynchronous programming models. I often combine generators with the for...of loop for clean iteration syntax, and I'm careful about error handling by using try/catch blocks and the generator's throw() method to propagate errors properly.
