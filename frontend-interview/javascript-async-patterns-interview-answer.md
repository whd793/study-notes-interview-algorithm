# JavaScript Asynchronous Patterns Interview Answer

JavaScript offers several patterns for handling asynchronous operations, each with different benefits. Callbacks were the original approach, but they can lead to callback hell with deeply nested operations. I still use them for simple cases or when working with APIs that expect callback functions.

Promises provide a more structured approach with .then() and .catch() chains for sequential operations. I frequently use Promise.all() for parallel operations and Promise.race() when I need the result from whichever promise resolves first. For error handling, I implement proper catch blocks and sometimes use Promise.allSettled() when I need to process mixed successes and failures.

Async/await, built on promises, offers the most readable syntax for asynchronous code. I structure try/catch blocks similarly to synchronous code, which improves readability and error handling. For parallel operations with async/await, I still use Promise.all() but with the await keyword. In real-world applications, I often implement retry logic for failed network requests using recursive async functions with exponential backoff strategies.
