# React Component Lifecycle Interview Answer

The React component lifecycle describes the different phases a component goes through from mounting to unmounting. In class components, mounting involves constructor, getDerivedStateFromProps, render, and componentDidMount. The update phase includes getDerivedStateFromProps, shouldComponentUpdate, render, getSnapshotBeforeUpdate, and componentDidUpdate. Finally, unmounting triggers componentWillUnmount.

With hooks, this lifecycle is conceptualized differently. The useState hook replaces state initialization in constructors, while useEffect combines the functionality of componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount depending on its dependency array. I use an empty dependency array for mount-only effects, specific dependencies for update detection, and the cleanup function for unmount logic.

Understanding this lifecycle is crucial for performance optimization and proper resource management. I ensure side effects like data fetching happen at the right time, clean up resources like event listeners and subscriptions during unmounting, and implement shouldComponentUpdate or React.memo to prevent unnecessary renders.
