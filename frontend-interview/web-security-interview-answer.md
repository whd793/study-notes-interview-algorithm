# Web Security Interview Answer

Web security is critical for protecting both users and applications from attacks. I implement several key security measures in my frontend development work to prevent common vulnerabilities.

To prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, I avoid directly inserting user input into the DOM, use frameworks that automatically escape content (like React), and implement Content Security Policy headers. For Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection, I ensure that authenticated actions use CSRF tokens and leverage SameSite cookie attributes.

I'm careful about data exposure in client-side code, avoiding storing sensitive information in localStorage or sessionStorage, which are vulnerable to XSS attacks. Instead, I use secure, HttpOnly cookies for sensitive data and authentication tokens. For API communication, I ensure all requests use HTTPS, validate all user inputs both client-side and server-side, and implement proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information.

I stay updated on security best practices through resources like the OWASP Top Ten and regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like npm audit.
