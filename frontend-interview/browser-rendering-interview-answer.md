# Browser Rendering Process Interview Answer

The browser rendering process converts HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into interactive web pages through several key steps. First, the browser parses HTML to create the Document Object Model (DOM) and CSS to create the CSS Object Model (CSSOM) - these are tree structures representing the page content and styles.

Next, the browser combines the DOM and CSSOM to create the render tree, which only includes visible elements with their computed styles. The layout (or reflow) step calculates the exact position and size of each element on the screen. Finally, the paint process converts the render tree into actual pixels on the screen.

Understanding this process helps me optimize performance. For example, I minimize DOM manipulations and group them where possible since each change can trigger layout and paint. I use properties like transform and opacity for animations because they're handled by the compositor thread and don't trigger the expensive layout phase. I also defer non-critical JavaScript and use async/defer attributes to prevent blocking the parsing process.
