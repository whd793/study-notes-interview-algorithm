# JavaScript Modules Interview Answer

JavaScript modules are a way to organize code into reusable, encapsulated pieces with their own scope. The module system helps avoid global namespace pollution and creates clearer dependency relationships between parts of an application.

I work with two main module formats: CommonJS (used primarily in Node.js) with require() and module.exports, and ES modules (the standard for modern browsers and newer Node.js versions) with import and export statements. ES modules offer advantages like static analysis, which enables tree-shaking to eliminate unused code during bundling.

In a typical frontend project, I use ES modules to explicitly declare dependencies between files. I export only what's needed using named exports for multiple functions/values and default exports for main component functionality. For large applications, I organize modules into feature directories with clear entry points, being careful to avoid circular dependencies which can cause hard-to-debug issues.
