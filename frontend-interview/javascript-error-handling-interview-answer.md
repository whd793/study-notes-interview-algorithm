# JavaScript Error Handling Interview Answer

Effective error handling is crucial for robust JavaScript applications. I implement several strategies depending on the context. For synchronous code, I use try/catch blocks to capture and handle errors gracefully, ensuring the application doesn't crash when unexpected conditions occur.

For asynchronous code, I handle errors differently based on the pattern: with promises, I add .catch() handlers to promise chains or use try/catch with async/await. I'm careful to avoid unhandled promise rejections by implementing global handlers with window.addEventListener('unhandledrejection') in browsers or process.on('unhandledRejection') in Node.js.

For production applications, I combine client-side error tracking using services like Sentry with custom error boundaries in React to capture component errors. I create custom error classes to differentiate between error types, which helps in providing appropriate user feedback and simplifies error filtering in tracking systems. I also implement retry logic for transient errors like network failures, using exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming servers during outages.
