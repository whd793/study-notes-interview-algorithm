# JavaScript Event Loop Interview Answer

The JavaScript event loop is the mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations despite being single-threaded. It manages execution by processing code through several key components: the call stack for executing functions, Web APIs for handling asynchronous operations, callback and microtask queues for scheduling tasks, and the event loop itself which coordinates when tasks run.

The loop works by pushing function calls onto the call stack, delegating asynchronous operations to Web APIs, and then moving their callbacks to queue structures when they're completed. When the call stack is empty, the event loop first processes all microtasks (like Promise callbacks), then takes one task from the callback queue (like setTimeout callbacks).

This explains common behaviors like why promise callbacks execute before setTimeout callbacks, even with a timeout of zero. Understanding the event loop helps me avoid blocking the main thread with long operations, which is crucial for maintaining responsive UIs.
