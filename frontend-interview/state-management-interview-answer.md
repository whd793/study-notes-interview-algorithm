# State Management Interview Answer

State management refers to how we handle and update application data over time. In modern frontend applications, I approach state management by first categorizing state based on its scope and usage patterns.

For component-level state that doesn't need to be shared, I use React's useState or useReducer hooks. When state needs to be shared across multiple components, I evaluate whether Context API is sufficient or if a more robust solution like Redux is needed based on the complexity of state interactions and the size of the application.

For large applications, I prefer Redux Toolkit as it reduces boilerplate and provides sensible defaults. I organize state into slices based on domain concepts rather than technical concerns, and I keep reducers pure and side-effect free, handling async operations through middleware like Redux Thunk or Redux Saga.

The key principles I follow are keeping state DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), maintaining a single source of truth, and making state changes predictable through immutability and unidirectional data flow.
