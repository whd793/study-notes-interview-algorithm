# Explain CSS Positioning

**Answer:**

CSS positioning controls how elements are positioned in the document flow. There are five main position values: `static`, `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, and `sticky`.

## Static Positioning

`position: static` is the default positioning for all HTML elements. Elements appear in the normal document flow.

```css
.default {
  position: static;
  /* Offset properties (top, right, bottom, left) have no effect */
}
```

## Relative Positioning

`position: relative` positions an element relative to its normal position in the document flow.

```css
.relative {
  position: relative;
  top: 20px;
  left: 30px;
  /* Moved 20px down and 30px right from its normal position */
  /* Still occupies original space in the document flow */
}
```

Key points:
- The element maintains its space in the normal flow
- Other elements aren't affected by the repositioning
- Provides a positioning context for absolutely positioned children

## Absolute Positioning

`position: absolute` positions an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (or the document body if none exists).

```css
.container {
  position: relative; /* Creates positioning context */
  height: 200px;
}

.absolute {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50px;
  right: 10px;
  /* Positioned 50px from top and 10px from right of container */
  /* Removed from normal document flow */
}
```

Key points:
- Removed from normal document flow (no space reserved)
- Positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor
- If no positioned ancestor exists, positions relative to the initial containing block (usually the viewport)

## Fixed Positioning

`position: fixed` positions an element relative to the viewport, so it stays in place even when scrolling.

```css
.fixed-header {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  /* Stays at the top of the viewport when scrolling */
  /* Removed from normal document flow */
}
```

Key points:
- Removed from normal document flow
- Always positioned relative to the viewport
- Ignores scrolling
- Common for headers, navigation bars, and persistent UI elements

## Sticky Positioning

`position: sticky` is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. The element is treated as relative until it crosses a specified threshold, then treated as fixed.

```css
.sticky-nav {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  /* Behaves like relative positioning until the viewport reaches top: 0 */
  /* Then behaves like fixed positioning */
}
```

Key points:
- Initially behaves like relative positioning
- Becomes fixed when the specified offset position is reached during scrolling
- Must set at least one threshold value (top, right, bottom, or left)
- Contained by its closest scrolling ancestor

## The z-index Property

When elements overlap due to positioning, the `z-index` property controls which elements appear on top.

```css
.behind {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 1;
}

.front {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 2; /* Higher value appears in front */
}
```

Key points:
- Only works on positioned elements (not static)
- Higher values appear in front of elements with lower values
- Creates stacking contexts, which can affect how descendant elements stack

## Common Positioning Patterns

### Centering with Absolute Positioning

```css
.centered {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  /* Perfect centering within parent */
}
```

### Fixed Header with Content Adjustment

```css
.fixed-header {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 60px;
}

.content {
  padding-top: 60px; /* Prevents content from being hidden under header */
}
```

### Sticky Section Headers

```css
.section-header {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  background: white;
  /* Header sticks to top when scrolling through section */
}
```

Understanding positioning is crucial for creating complex layouts and interactive UI elements in modern web development.
