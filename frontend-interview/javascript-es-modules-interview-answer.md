# JavaScript ES Modules Interview Answer

ES Modules (ESM) are the standard JavaScript module system, providing a way to organize code into reusable, encapsulated pieces. Unlike older formats like CommonJS, ES Modules have static import/export declarations that enable static analysis, which allows bundlers to implement tree-shaking to eliminate unused code.

I use named exports for utility functions or components where a file exports multiple items, and default exports for main module functionality like a primary React component. The static nature of ES Modules means imports must be at the top level, but dynamic imports (import()) provide a way to load modules conditionally or on demand for code splitting.

When working with ES Modules directly in browsers, I include the type="module" attribute on script tags and ensure proper MIME types are set on the server. Module scripts are deferred by default and execute in strict mode. For Node.js applications, I'm mindful of the dual module systems (CommonJS and ESM) and use the appropriate file extensions or package.json configurations to specify which system to use.
