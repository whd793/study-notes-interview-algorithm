# JavaScript ES6 Features Interview Answer

ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced significant improvements to JavaScript that I use daily. The arrow functions provide a concise syntax and lexical this binding, which helps avoid the common 'this' binding issues in callbacks. I use destructuring to extract values from objects and arrays cleanly, while template literals make string interpolation and multiline strings much more readable.

The let and const declarations offer block scoping, which helps prevent variable hoisting bugs common with var. I leverage default parameters to make functions more flexible and readable, and the rest/spread operators for working with arrays and function arguments elegantly.

Promises are essential for handling asynchronous operations clearly, avoiding callback hell. For more complex applications, I use ES6 modules to organize code into reusable, maintainable files with explicit imports and exports. Classes provide a cleaner syntax for object-oriented patterns, though I'm careful to remember they're syntactic sugar over prototypal inheritance.
