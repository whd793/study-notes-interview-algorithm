# Webpack and Module Bundling Interview Answer

Webpack is a module bundler that processes JavaScript applications, resolving dependencies and generating optimized bundles. I use it to transform modern JavaScript with features like ES modules, JSX, and TypeScript into browser-compatible code while optimizing for production.

The core webpack concepts I work with are entry points (where to start building the dependency graph), output (where to emit the bundles), loaders (transforming files before adding to the bundle), and plugins (performing broader build tasks). For a typical React project, I configure babel-loader for transpiling JSX and modern JavaScript, css-loader and style-loader for handling styles, and file-loader for assets like images.

For performance optimization, I implement code splitting to generate multiple bundles loaded on demand, use the SplitChunksPlugin to extract common dependencies into shared bundles, and apply tree shaking to eliminate dead code. I also set up different configurations for development (with source maps and fast builds) and production (with minification, optimization, and cache strategies).
